The on-screen graphics of ATN News. This is a bundle for [NodeCG] v1.6 so you
need to install it before usage and know its basic concepts. 

## Usage

The dashboard is pretty easy to use. One thing you need take care of is the
Ticker if you'll use it.

The current implementation of Ticker takes headlines from a `.txt` file
separated by newline character so it's needed to upload such an asset and
select it in the dashboard.
